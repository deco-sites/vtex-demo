    "content": "<p>Shouts are loud, yet briefly lasting, and annoying. Whispers might take longer to get heard, but their power is enduring, and pleasing, connecting generations. Since its inception in 1934, CANALI has followed a gentle approach that stems from the will to have a whispered yet long-lasting presence in the world and write one’s own history in subtleness. This history is now 90 years long, and still unfolding. The occasion and its celebration trigger a leap into the future with the awareness and strength that comes from the wealth of knowledge of what has been done and the openness to what can be done.</p><p></p><h2 style=\"text-align: start\">Canali's first 90 years</h2><p style=\"text-align: start\"></p><p>Canali began in 1934, when Giovanni Canali joined his brother’s Giacomo tailoring shop. After World War II, the second-generation Canali brothers restarted the business with vision and determination, focusing initially on raincoats, to later encompass tailoring and formalwear. Now in its third generation, Canali remains an independent family-run business that retains tailoring at the core whilst adapting to the continuous men’s market evolutions, aided by constant style innovation and an assured integration of technology into the artisanal process.</p><p></p><h2>Naba for Canali</h2><p></p><p>The collaboration between Naba and Canali represents a creative dialogue between past and future, between static and dynamic. An immersive experience born from the meeting of different artistic expressions and mediums, ranging from the material pictorial to the pixel generated by artificial intelligence.</p>",
